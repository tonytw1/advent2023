47/50 this year which was a personal best.

Kotlin seems to produce consistently lower line counts than Java.
The syntax for common operations like sort, map and filter is more memorable.

[Day 12](src/test/kotlin/Day12.kt) part 2 was the most enlightening exercise.

Part 1 was quickly solved using global vars. 
It took alot of thought to successfully refactor the visit method into something with a cachable method signature.
